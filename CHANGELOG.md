### [Issue #20](https://github.com/uw-asa/wiw-events-shifts-display/issues/20) - Multi-Architecture Builds

- `.dockerignore` updated to exclude more items.
- Altered the dockerfile to a template for builds that take the Balena Fleet architecture into account and builds based on whatever architecture is needed for that target device arch.
- 2 architectures tested in build process: armv7hf (pi2, pi3) and aarch64 (pi3-64, pi4-64).
